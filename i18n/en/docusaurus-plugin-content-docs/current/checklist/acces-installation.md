# Access to Electrical Installation - Belgian Electrical Regulations

Ensuring secure and compliant access to an electrical installation is a fundamental obligation, not only for user safety but also for maintenance and compliance checks. This section of the checklist details the inspections needed to ensure that the installation is accessible and in compliance with the requirements of the **Belgian Electrical Regulations**.

> **🔍 Why is it important?** According to **Article 123.4** of the Belgian Electrical Regulations, unrestricted and secure access to electrical installations is required to allow quick intervention in case of an incident or maintenance. Inadequate access increases the risk of accidents and can compromise the safety of occupants.

## 1. Preparing Access to Key Components of the Installation

All components of the electrical installation must be accessible for maintenance interventions and compliance checks.

| **Components**            | **Requirement under Belgian Regulations**           | **Advice** |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------|
| **Electrical Panel**      | Must be accessible at all times (Art. 123.5)        | Ensure it is not obstructed by furniture or other objects. |
| **Power Outlets**         | Must appear on schematics and be accessible for inspection (Art. 250.2) | Ensure that all key outlets are visible and listed on the schematic. Temporarily inaccessible outlets (e.g., behind furniture) are tolerated but must be documented. |
| **Circuit Breakers and Fuses** | Direct and unobstructed access required (Art. 131.2) | Label each circuit breaker for quick identification in case of an outage. |
| **Meter / Meter Room**    | Must be accessible at all times, especially in buildings (Art. 124.3) | Ensure the meter is easily accessible for readings, maintenance, and interventions during outages. |
| **Switches**              | Must be visibly placed and easily accessible (Art. 251.3) | Avoid placing switches behind doors or furniture. They should be positioned for quick and safe access. |
| **Lighting Fixtures**     | Must be securely installed and accessible for maintenance (Art. 252.1) | Ensure that fixtures are securely mounted and easily serviceable or replaceable. |
| **Junction Boxes**        | Considered as part of the electrical panel, must be accessible and listed on schematics (Art. 123.7) | Place junction boxes in accessible areas (not behind sealed walls) to allow future interventions without difficulty. |

> **💡 Tip:** Label each circuit breaker in the panel to indicate the areas it protects. Clear identification simplifies circuit management and aids in emergencies.

## 2. Compliance with Safety Distances

The Belgian Electrical Regulations mandate minimum safety distances around electrical components to prevent hazards. These rules must be observed to ensure the safety of users and technicians.

### 2.1. Minimum Clearance around the Electrical Panel

The electrical panel must have a clear space of at least **60 cm** around it, in accordance with **Article 133.1** of the regulations. This space allows for safe intervention without obstructions.

:::warning
**Warning:** A cluttered area around the electrical panel makes maintenance operations dangerous and can hinder emergency interventions. Non-compliance with this requirement is a violation of the regulations.
:::

### 2.2. Location of the Panel and Environmental Conditions

According to **Article 134.2**, the electrical panel must not be installed in damp areas or near a water source. Ensure the panel is placed in a dry, well-ventilated area to reduce the risk of short circuits.

> **Safety Advice:** Install permanent lighting near the electrical panel to facilitate interventions, even during power outages.

## 3. Securing Access to Installations

### 3.1. Protection against Unauthorized Access

Electrical installations must be secured against unauthorized access, particularly from children. Use locking devices and warning signs as required by **Article 126.7** of the regulations.

> **💡 Good to Know:** Electrical panels installed in public or accessible areas must be locked or placed in a closed cabinet. This reduces the risk of accidental handling by unauthorized persons.

### 3.2. Danger Signage

According to **Article 125.3**, it is mandatory to add warning signs to indicate electrical hazards and inform occupants of the risks. Warning signs must be visible and comply with standards to minimize the risk of electrocution.

> **📢 Attention:** An electrical panel without proper signage increases the risk of accidents. Install clear warning signs to prevent unauthorized handling.

## 4. Regular Maintenance and Access Checks

To ensure continuous secure and compliant access, perform regular inspections. Installations evolve over time, so it is crucial to check that access remains clear and equipment is in good condition.

| **Action**                          | **Recommended Frequency**   | **Advice** |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|
| Check for unobstructed access       | Every 3 months              | Ensure that no objects block access to the panel. |
| Inspect warning signs               | Every 6 months              | Replace worn or damaged signs for optimal visibility. |
| Verify lighting near the panel      | Annually                    | Ensure that lighting is functional and easily accessible. |

> **📅 Plan Your Maintenance:** A maintenance schedule can help keep installations compliant with regulations and prevent risks related to inadequate access. Use a maintenance management app to plan these inspections.
