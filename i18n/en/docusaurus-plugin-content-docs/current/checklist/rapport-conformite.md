# Electrical Compliance Report

Presenting the previous **compliance certificate** during inspections is crucial for ensuring an optimal review of the electrical installation. This document, required by the **Belgian Electrical Regulations**, certifies that your installation meets current safety standards, ensuring the protection of occupants and regulatory compliance.

---

## 1. Why Present the Previous Compliance Certificate?

### 1.1. A Valuable Historical Record for Inspection

The compliance report provides an overview of the installation at the time of the last inspection, including corrections made and elements requiring specific attention. It allows the inspector to:

- **Review Previous Corrections**: Ensure that **previous non-compliances** have been addressed.
- **Assess Modifications and Additions**: Simplify the inspection of new installations (e.g., added circuit, charging station).

:::tip üí° Practical Tip
Keep the compliance report accessible in a secure place, ideally near the main panel, as required by **Article 206.8** of the regulations. This ensures quick access for any inspection or modification.
:::

### 1.2. Proof of Compliance and Installation Safety

The compliance report certifies the safety of the installation during the last inspection, which is vital for:

- **Safety Assurance**: A valid report reduces the risk of violations and demonstrates that your installation is compliant.
- **Insurance and Legal Matters**: Some insurance providers require a compliance report to cover electrical incidents. A valid report can streamline the claims process in case of an issue.

:::info üîç Good to Know
In Belgium, a compliance report is generally valid for **25 years** for compliant residential properties, but more frequent inspections may be required in case of non-compliance or major modifications.

## 2. Installation Review and Identification of Non-Compliance

During inspections, inspectors refer to the compliance report to verify that each component of the installation meets the requirements of the regulations. The table below outlines the key elements inspected:

| **Checked Element**             | **Inspector's Verification**                                                                                                    |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Electrical Panel**            | Compliance with **Article 178.3**: circuit protection, accessibility, and clear identification of each circuit.                  |
| **Protected Outlets and Circuits** | Verification of circuit breakers and fuses, presence of adequate differential protection for each circuit.                      |
| **Grounding System**            | Continuity check of the grounding system according to the regulations, **Article 202.7**; verification of protection against electric shocks. |
| **Recent Modifications**        | Verification that recent additions (e.g., charging stations) meet regulatory standards, ensuring a safe and compliant installation. |

:::caution ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution
Any non-compliance identified during the inspection must be thoroughly documented, along with a deadline for corrective action. A clear report facilitates interventions and follow-ups, ensuring the safety of the installations.
:::

### Importance of the Previous Certificate for Modifications

Although the previous certificate is not required for a complete new inspection (the inspector must recheck the entire installation), it can be valuable in case of **partial modifications**. For example, for work such as adding an electrical charging station, the report allows quick verification of the **compliance of the base installation**, simplifying the evaluation of the impact of new changes.

---

## 3. Requirement to Keep the Report Near the Main Panel

According to **Article 206.8**, the compliance report must be kept in close proximity to the **main electrical panel**. This ensures immediate accessibility for inspectors, electricians, and other authorized professionals. Here are the benefits of this requirement:

- **Accessibility in Emergencies**: In case of an emergency or outage, the compliance report allows for quick and safe intervention.
- **Transparency for Inspectors**: Inspectors can directly review installation details to avoid redundant tests or errors during evaluation.

:::tip üí° Tip
If you are planning future electrical modifications, such as circuit renovations or adding equipment, carefully retain the current report. It can serve as a valuable reference for electricians and simplify administrative and regulatory procedures.

## Conclusion

The **compliance report** is more than just a certificate: it is a key document for the safety, transparency, and compliance of electrical installations. Keeping this report up to date and accessible is essential for facilitating inspections and ensuring user protection.
