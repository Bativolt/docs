# Machine Documentation

**Machine documentation** is crucial for ensuring safety and compliance in electrical installations, especially in industrial and commercial environments. Although the **Belgian Electrical Regulations** do not systematically require documentation for all machines, specific cases have mandatory requirements.

---

## 1. Importance of Machine Documentation

### 1.1. Safety and Compliance

Machine documentation includes **user manuals**, **technical data sheets**, **certificates of compliance**, and **installation plans**. It plays a key role in:

- **Ensuring User Safety**: The information allows operators to follow best practices for safe machine use.
- **Guaranteeing Compliance with Standards**: The documentation serves as proof that the machines comply with current standards, which is essential during compliance checks, especially for high-risk installations.

:::tip 💡 Practical Tip
Store machine documentation in a secure and easily accessible location, ideally near the machine itself. This accessibility facilitates inspections and emergency interventions.
:::

### 1.2. Examples of Machines Requiring Documentation

Certain machines, due to their complexity and associated risks, often require detailed documentation:

| **Type of Machine**                | **Examples**                                   |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Presses**                       | Hydraulic presses, mechanical presses          |
| **Lifting Equipment**             | Cranes, forklifts                              |
| **Machine Tools**                 | Lathes, milling machines                       |
| **Material Processing Equipment** | Crushers, industrial mixers                    |
| **Agricultural Machinery**        | Tractors, combine harvesters                   |
| **Food Production Equipment**     | Packaging lines, industrial ovens              |
| **Electrical Equipment**          | Transformers, generators                       |
| **HVAC Equipment**                | HVAC systems, cold storage units               |

> **Note**: Some machines may be subject to additional European regulations, such as the **Machinery Safety Directive**.

## 2. Obligations Under Belgian Electrical Regulations

### 2.1. Machines Subject to Specific Regulations

The **Belgian Electrical Regulations** require documentation for machines in specific situations, such as:

- **High-Risk Machines**: Machines used in industrial environments with increased risk (explosions, fires) must have compliant documentation, as specified in **Article 105.2 of the regulations**.
- **Installations with Specific Safety Requirements**: Equipment subject to specific safety directives, such as those related to occupational health and safety, must have documents certifying their compliance.

> **Important**: If a machine has a high-risk potential, a **risk analysis** should be included in its documentation to identify potential hazards and preventive measures.

### 2.2. High-Risk Installations

In installations with high risk (e.g., chemical industries or material processing plants), documentation must be more comprehensive to meet enhanced safety requirements. This requirement aligns with **Articles 108.3 and 108.4 of the regulations**.

:::warning ⚠️ Note
For high-risk installations, any missing or incomplete documentation can result in penalties or costly compliance obligations.
:::

## 3. Documentation Requirements

### 3.1. Mandatory Content

Machine documentation must include several elements to comply with the standards of the Belgian Electrical Regulations:

| **Element**                  | **Description**                                                                                      |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **User Manuals**             | Provide detailed instructions on the use and maintenance of the machine.                            |
| **Certificates of Compliance** | Certify that the machine has been tested and meets the current safety standards.               |
| **Installation Plans**       | Specify how the machine should be installed and connected to electrical networks.                  |

> **💼 Tip**: The documentation must be updated whenever the machine or installation is modified to avoid non-compliance issues.

### 3.2. Accessibility of Documentation

Accessibility of the documentation is crucial for ensuring user safety:

- **On-Site Availability**: It must be stored near the machine or in a designated area for easy consultation, in accordance with **Articles 112.2 and 113.4 of the regulations**.
- **User Training**: Users must be trained to consult and understand the documentation to minimize the risk of accidents, as specified in **Article 114 of the regulations**.

---

## 4. Special Cases

### 4.1. High-Risk Machines

For machines considered to have high risks, the documentation must include a **detailed risk assessment**:

- **Risk Analysis**: A specific analysis is required for these machines to record the safety measures adopted.
- **Maintenance and Monitoring**: The documentation must include a regular maintenance schedule to ensure the safety of the equipment.

:::info Example
For lifting machines, a maintenance plan including regular inspections is necessary to ensure safety and proper functioning, in accordance with Belgian Electrical Regulations.
:::

### 4.2. Specific Standards and European Directives

Machines must also comply with European directives, particularly for mobile equipment and material processing machines, as stipulated by the **European Directive 2006/42/EC** on machinery.

> **Good to Know**: This directive imposes additional safety requirements for machines imported or manufactured in Europe, enhancing compliance and safety.

---

## 5. Conclusion

Although the **Belgian Electrical Regulations** do not systematically mandate documentation for all machines, specific requirements apply to high-risk equipment and industrial environments. Having comprehensive documentation not only ensures compliance but also guarantees the safety of users and operators.

The next step in our compliance checklist focuses on the **electrical dossier**, which will summarize all the necessary elements to ensure the conformity of electrical installations.

> **Safety Reminder**: Documentation is an essential foundation for any industrial installation. Keep it up to date and easily accessible to facilitate inspections and ensure optimal safety.
