### Section 7.1.3. Determining General Characteristics − Volume Classification

#### Subsection 7.1.3.1. Volumes

**Safety volumes** define the boundaries within which certain equipment can be installed. These volumes are crucial for determining the required levels of protection:

- **Volume 0**: Limited to the inside of the bathtub or shower tray. No electrical installation is permitted, except for specific extra-low voltage devices.
- **Volume 1**: Above Volume 0, up to a height of 2.25 m. Only equipment specifically designed for this volume is allowed.
- **Volume 2**: Surrounds Volume 1 for a distance of 0.6 m, allowing a wider choice of devices but with restrictions.

#### Subsection 7.1.3.2. Dimensions of Volumes − Plan View

The dimensions of the volumes in **plan view** define the lateral extent of each volume around the bathtub or shower. Depending on the distance and the area:

1. **Volume 0**: Limited to the interior of the bathtub or shower tray.
2. **Volume 1**: Extends vertically from the bathtub.
3. **Volume 2**: Extends laterally, ensuring that any socket or switch is at a safe distance.

#### Subsection 7.1.3.3. Dimensions of Volumes − Elevation View

In **elevation view**, each volume is assessed in height to ensure the safety of installations in relation to water sources. Electrical devices must adhere to minimum height requirements in Zones 1 and 2.

### Section 7.1.4. Protection Against Electric Shocks

#### Subsection 7.1.4.1. Protection of Installations in Bathrooms and Shower Rooms

Installations must protect users from **electric shocks** by:

- **Automatic tripping** of residual current devices (RCDs) in case of current faults.
- **Equipment with appropriate protection rating** (minimum IPX4 for certain volumes).

#### Subsection 7.1.4.2. Protection Against Indirect Contacts Using Extra-Low Voltage

**Extra-low voltage (ELV)** is often recommended in wet areas to prevent indirect contact. It reduces risks by using a voltage below 50V AC, making shocks less dangerous.

#### Subsection 7.1.4.3. Protection Against Direct Contacts − Equipment Protection Rating

Installed devices must have an adequate **IP protection rating** to prevent water ingress. For example:

| Volume         | Minimum Protection Rating |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Volume 0**   | IPX7 (immersion)          |
| **Volume 1**   | IPX4 (water splashes)     |
| **Volume 2**   | IPX4 or higher            |

#### Subsection 7.1.4.4. Additional Equipotential Bonding

Additional equipotential bonding is required to create a potential balance between metallic elements. It reduces the risk of shocks in case of a potential difference:

- **Application**: Must be installed between metallic elements such as pipes, faucets, and equipment connected to the grounding system.

#### Subsection 7.1.4.5. Embedded Heating Elements in Floors

Underfloor heating systems in bathrooms must include thermal protections to prevent overheating risks. Depending on the type of heating:

For each **type of volume**:

1. **Volume 0**: Strictly limited to sealed, extra-low voltage devices.
2. **Volume 1**: Allows certain specific devices with IPX4 protection or higher.
3. **Volume 2**: A wider range of devices is permitted, but all must be suitable for possible exposure to moisture.

External influences, such as temperature and humidity, must be considered to ensure a durable and safe installation. This ensures that every installed element can withstand the conditions of use in areas containing water.

> :::info 💧 **Good to Know:** Bathrooms are subject to high levels of humidity and steam. The materials and equipment installed should be chosen based on their resistance to external influences to guarantee long life and continuous safety.

---

#### Subsection 7.1.5.2. Electrical Conduits

**Electrical conduits** in bathrooms and shower areas must follow strict rules for protection against moisture and splashing. Conduits are often installed in walls or ceilings to minimize the risk of direct water contact. It is essential that ducts, pipes, or conduits are suitable for the zones in which they are installed:

1. **Volume 1**: Conduits require high water protection (IPX4).
2. **Volume 2**: Conduits may be exposed to moisture and must meet a minimum of IPX3.

Additionally, the conduits should ideally be made of corrosion-resistant materials to ensure the longevity of the installation.

> :::caution ⚠️ **Material Warning:** The conduits used must be made of anti-corrosion materials to prevent long-term degradation in a humid environment.

---

#### Subsection 7.1.5.3. Electrical Equipment

The **electrical equipment** used in bathrooms and showers must be designed to withstand the specific conditions of the environment. This includes devices such as:

### Section 7.2.3. Protection Against Electric Shocks

#### Subsection 7.2.3.1. Protection Against Indirect Contacts Using Extra-Low Voltage

To minimize shock risks, the use of **extra-low voltage (ELV)** is highly recommended in and around swimming pools. This measure ensures that even in the case of accidental contact, the current would be insufficient to cause a dangerous shock.

- **Maximum Voltage**: Approximately 12V AC (alternating current) or 30V DC (direct current).
- **Applications**: Used for lighting and certain cleaning devices.

> :::example 🔋 **Practical Example:** Submerged pool lights typically use ELV to minimize the risk of shock in the event of accidental contact.

---

#### Subsection 7.2.3.2. Protection Against Direct Contacts − Equipment Protection Rating

Electrical equipment must have a **high IP protection rating** to prevent water ingress and contact with conductive elements. For example:

- **Volume 0**: IPX8 required for submerged devices.

| Anti-corrosive materials   | Protection against chemical leaks                                          |
| Labeling                   | Clear indications of hazards, precautions, and technical parameters        |

:::warning
⚠️ **Caution**: Inadequate labeling can lead to improper interventions, increasing the risk of accidents. Ensure proper signage is in place.
:::

3. **Access and Intervention**  
   Cabinets should be designed to allow safe access to the batteries, with protections against short circuits and alarm systems for temperature anomalies or leaks.

:::note
🔍 **Important Note**: Implementing an emergency response plan for battery repairs and maintenance is crucial to ensure technician safety.

## CHAPTER 7.112. LOW-VOLTAGE DOMESTIC PHOTOVOLTAIC INSTALLATIONS (≤ 10 KVA)

Photovoltaic installations are growing in popularity and play a key role in the energy transition. The standards for the installation and maintenance of these systems must ensure long-term safety and efficiency.

### Section 7.112.1. Scope of Application

This section applies to low-voltage domestic photovoltaic installations with a power rating of up to 10 kVA. It covers all stages, from design to commissioning, including testing and necessary reports to guarantee the installation’s compliance.

:::info
📌 **Information**: Photovoltaic systems allow households to reduce their energy dependence and lower their carbon footprint.
:::

---

### Section 7.112.2. Specific Measures

1. **Protection Against Electric Shocks**  
   Photovoltaic installations generate high direct current voltages, requiring strict precautions. Panels and inverters must be protected against direct and indirect contact to prevent electric shock.

:::caution
🚨 **Warning**: Direct contact with live components can be fatal. Follow safety procedures rigorously during installation.
:::

2. **Surge Protection**  
   Installations must include surge protection devices against lightning strikes or grid faults. This typically involves using surge protectors at connection points.

3. **Grounding**  
   Proper grounding is essential for safety. All components, including panel mounts, must be connected to the ground to dissipate surges and ensure the installation's safety.
