# Part 8 - Specific Requirements for Existing Electrical Installations

## CHAPTER 8.1. INTRODUCTION

Part 8 of the Belgian Electrical Regulations addresses the requirements to ensure the safety of existing electrical installations, considering their age and the specific challenges of bringing them up to standard.

:::info üí° **Note:**
Some older installations may retain specific features if they meet minimum safety conditions. The goal is to ensure safety while considering the existing infrastructure.
:::

### Section 8.1.1. Definitions

To better understand this section, here are some important definitions:

- **Existing Electrical Installations**: Systems compliant with older standards, sometimes requiring adaptations to meet current requirements.
- **Derogatory Provisions**: Exceptions to new standards, tailored for installations in service before the new regulations were enforced.

### Section 8.1.2. Existing Electrical Installations Inspected Under the Old Regulations

Installations validated under the old regulations may require re-evaluation to ensure their safety according to the latest standards.

| **Verification Steps**     | **Description**                                                |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Risk Assessment            | Identification of deviations from new standards and required adjustments. |
| Upgrade                    | Depending on the risk level, a partial or complete adaptation may be needed. |

## CHAPTER 8.2. DEROGATORY PROVISIONS FOR EXISTING DOMESTIC ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS

Older domestic installations may benefit from specific derogations, allowing them to comply without a complete overhaul.

### Section 8.2.1. Existing Parts of Older Domestic Electrical Installations

Some parts of older installations can be retained if they adhere to safety principles.

- **Wiring**: Well-maintained cables can be preserved.
- **Protective Devices**: If they function correctly and pose no immediate danger, replacement is not mandatory.

### Section 8.2.2. Existing Parts of Domestic Installations Under Old Regulations

Installations compliant with the old regulations but not meeting current standards must include:

1. **Visual and Functional Inspections**  
   Detect obsolete or defective elements.

2. **Temporary Solutions**  
   Temporary protections can enhance safety while awaiting full adaptation.

:::tip Best Practices üîç
Conduct regular visual inspections to anticipate defects and plan gradual updates if necessary.

## CHAPTER 8.3. DEROGATORY PROVISIONS FOR EXISTING NON-DOMESTIC ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS

Non-domestic installations in service also benefit from derogations to ensure a gradual path to compliance.

### Section 8.3.1. Older Non-Domestic Electrical Installations

Non-domestic electrical installations in use must adhere to certain safety rules without requiring immediate modifications.

#### Subsection 8.3.1.1. Installations Not Permanently Occupied

In environments not continuously occupied:

- **Passive Protection**: Reduces risks in case of failure.
- **Periodic Inspections**: Regular checks monitor the condition of the installation.

#### Subsection 8.3.1.2. Installations in Workplaces

In workplaces, additional protections are required:

- **Additional Safety Devices**: Enhancements to reduce risks.
- **Regular Monitoring**: Ensures early detection of defects before they become hazardous.

### Section 8.3.2. Non-Domestic Installations Under Old Regulations

Installations compliant with previous standards require adjustments to meet current requirements.

| Evaluation Criteria              | Requirement                                                   |

## Conclusion of Part 8 - Inspections and Safety of Older Electrical Installations

Part 8 of the Belgian Electrical Regulations focuses on control and safety measures for existing electrical installations, particularly those that have never been inspected or where compliance is only partial. This section emphasizes the importance of inspection visits to evaluate the safety and capacity of these installations to meet current demands, especially when subjected to changes like a power increase or during a property sale. Key points covered include:

- **Purpose of Inspections**: Ensure that existing installations can handle current demands safely while identifying potential weaknesses. A thorough evaluation helps determine if modifications are necessary to enhance safety.

- **Specific Inspections**: Each inspection visit includes specific steps, from visual inspections to checks of protective devices and grounding systems. These inspections help prevent risks of overload and short circuits.

- **Compliance Reports and Recommendations**: At the end of each inspection, a report documents the results, highlights any violations, and offers recommendations for future visits, ensuring continuous safety improvements.

- **Mandatory Inspections During Property Sale**: During the sale of a property, an inspection visit is required to ensure the installations are safe for the future owner.

- **Preventive Checks for Non-Domestic Installations**: In low-traffic areas such as warehouses or technical rooms, basic inspections are conducted to ensure that minimal safety devices are in place, even if the installations do not comply with the latest standards.

By following these guidelines, older installations can be secured and gradually updated, thus complying with the Belgian Electrical Regulations while minimizing risks for users and property owners.
