# Part 6 - Inspection of Installations

## CHAPTER 6.1. INTRODUCTION

The **inspection of electrical installations** is essential to ensure the safety of people and property, as well as to maintain compliance with standards and regulations. These inspections help detect defects or weaknesses in electrical systems that could otherwise lead to risks of fire, electrocution, or other serious incidents.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è Importance of Regular Inspections
Electrical installations that are not inspected regularly may develop hidden defects, increasing the risk of serious accidents, such as short circuits and fires.
:::

Regular inspections are particularly important in high-risk environments, such as industrial installations or public buildings, and are mandatory for certain types of installations to ensure ongoing compliance.

---

## CHAPTER 6.2. SCOPE OF APPLICATION

The scope of **electrical installation inspections** covers all installations subject to current safety standards. This includes low-voltage, very low-voltage, and critical installations that require special attention. The inspections vary based on the type of installation, its use, and the environment in which it is installed.
