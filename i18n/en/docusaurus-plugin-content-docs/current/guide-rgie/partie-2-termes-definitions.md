# CHAPTER 2.5. EARTHING SYSTEMS

### Earthing Installation

An **earthing installation** is crucial for securing electrical installations. It redirects fault currents to the ground, reducing the risk of electric shock in the event of a failure. Here is a detailed explanation of the components shown in **Figure 2.10, pages 22-23**, to help both professionals and non-experts understand each part of this complex configuration.

#### Explanation of Earthing Components

1. **Main (1)** and **Supplementary (2) Equipotential Bonding**:
   Equipotential bonding connects all conductive metal parts in the installation to maintain the same electrical potential. Main equipotential bonding connects key parts of the installation (e.g., metal structures), while supplementary bonding adds local connections to enhance safety in specific areas.

2. **Protective Conductor (3)**:
   This conductor connects metal parts (e.g., machine frames) to the earth electrode. Its role is to direct fault currents to the ground in case of a short circuit, protecting users from electric shocks.

3. **Distributor Earth (4)**:
   An earth connection provided by the electricity distributor, creating a common ground reference for the entire electrical network, enhancing system safety.

4. **Main Protective Conductor (5)**:
   This conductor connects all installation masses to the main earth terminal, ensuring that all equipment linked to the network is protected against insulation failures.

5. **Main Earth Terminal (6)**:
   The central connection point for all earthing links in the installation. It serves as the primary node connecting the various protective conductors to the earthing network.

6. **Earth Disconnecting Device (7)**:
   A device that allows the earthing connection to be separated from the system, typically used for testing and maintenance. The disconnecting device can be activated to isolate the earth connection, facilitating earth resistance checks.

7. **Earth Conductor (8)**:
   This conductor connects the main earth terminal to the earth electrodes, ensuring an effective link between the installation network and the ground.

8. **User Earth Electrode (9)**:
   The user’s own earth electrode, typically buried, allows fault currents to dissipate safely into the ground. It must be installed at a sufficient depth (below the frost line) to maintain optimal conductivity.

9. **Metal Masses (10)**:
   All non-live metal parts of the installation, such as equipment casings, must be earthed. This ensures that in case of a fault, these surfaces do not become dangerously conductive.

10. **Structural Elements, Heating, Water, Gas (11-15)**:
    These structural and functional elements (e.g., water, gas, and heating pipes) are also connected to the earthing network. This prevents hazardous potential differences between these elements and other conductive parts of the installation, especially important in wet environments or areas where users may contact multiple conductive surfaces.

---

:::tip Role of Earthing Components
The various parts of the earthing network work together to secure the installation by reducing the risk of electric shock. Maintaining these connections in good condition is essential for the safety of electrical installations.
:::

---

### Overall Operation

The earthing diagram presented in **Figure 2.10** shows how conductors and earth electrodes are interconnected to form a complete protective circuit. This system ensures that in the event of a fault in a device or part of the installation, the leakage current is directed to the ground, where it can safely dissipate.

### Importance of Earth Resistance

The **earth resistance** (RE) must be equal to or less than 30 ohms to guarantee effective fault current dissipation. A high RE could limit dissipation capacity, increasing the risk of electric shock.

:::warning Safety Measures
Ensure to check earth resistance during initial installation and at regular intervals, especially in environments where humidity and temperature can affect soil properties.
:::

### Key Terms and Components of Earthing

- **Earth**: The ground or a conductive material used to dissipate fault currents.
- **Earth Electrode**: A buried conductive element that ensures a good connection with the earth.
  - **Common Violation**: Shallow installation or placement in unsuitable soil.
  - **Solution**: Bury the electrode below the frost line (60 cm) and ensure an **earth resistance (RE) ≤ 30 ohms**.

:::warning Earthing Measurement Caution
Excessive earth resistance can be a risk. Ensure to select an appropriate location for the electrodes.
:::

- **Auxiliary Earth and Probe**:
  - **Auxiliary Earth**: Used to measure the dispersion resistance.
