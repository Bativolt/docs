# Circuits Not Protected by a 30mA Residual Current Circuit Breaker

## Introduction

**30mA residual current circuit breakers** are essential safety devices that protect users against the risk of electrocution by detecting current leaks. Since the regulatory updates of July 2023, these breakers are required for all circuits, with some exceptions. This page provides an in-depth look at the role of these devices, new requirements, exceptions, and the implications of non-compliance.

## 1. Importance of Protection by Residual Current Circuit Breakers

### 1.1. Role of Residual Current Circuit Breakers

A **30mA residual current circuit breaker** detects current leaks exceeding 30mA and immediately cuts off the power, reducing the risk of electrocution. This device is particularly crucial in wet areas or environments where the risk of contact with water is high.

> **Did You Know?** Most electrocution accidents occur when insulation is faulty. 30mA residual current circuit breakers provide an additional layer of protection by interrupting the circuit as soon as a current leak is detected.

### 1.2. Circuit Safety

Protecting circuits with residual current breakers is critical in areas like bathrooms, kitchens, and technical rooms, where humidity increases the risk of electric shock.

## 2. Regulatory Changes in July 2023

### 2.1. New RGIE Regulation

Since July 2023, the **General Regulations on Electrical Installations (RGIE)** require the presence of 30mA residual current circuit breakers for all circuits, except for a few specific exemptions. This change aims to enhance the safety of electrical installations by reducing the number of accidents caused by insulation faults.

> **RGIE Tip:** Residual current circuit breakers should be installed in easily accessible locations to allow for regular testing.

### 2.2. Previous Obligations

Before this regulation, certain circuits were exempt, except for wet areas, which have always required 30mA protection to prevent the risk of electrocution in the event of contact with water.

---

## 3. Exceptions to the Regulation

### 3.1. Unprotected Electrical Circuits

Despite the new rules, some circuits may not require a 30mA residual current circuit breaker, such as:

- **External Lighting Circuits**: Under specific conditions, like compliance with safety standards, these circuits may be exempt.
  
- **Circuits for Non-Sensitive Electrical Devices**: Certain circuits for external appliances, rarely handled, may be exempt.

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** If in doubt, consult a professional to confirm whether your installation requires 30mA differential protection.

### 3.2. Requirements for Wet Areas

Bathrooms, kitchens, and other wet zones absolutely require protection by a 30mA residual current circuit breaker to comply with RGIE safety standards.

---

## 4. Regulatory Obligations and Responsibilities

### 4.1. Compliance with RGIE Standards

Failure to meet the protection requirements may lead to penalties and endanger users. Therefore, it is essential that all installations are checked for RGIE compliance.

### 4.2. Electricians' Responsibility

Electricians must ensure that all installations are secure and compliant. New installations and renovations must include the required protection devices to avoid any risk of accidents.

## 5. Protective Equipment: Selection and Installation

### 5.1. 30mA Residual Current Circuit Breakers: Choice and Cost

30mA circuit breakers are widely available in stores and typically cost between â‚¬30 and â‚¬100, depending on the model and capacity.

| **Model**                | **Estimated Price**  | **Common Usage**                            |
|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Standard 30mA            | â‚¬30 - â‚¬50            | Bathrooms, kitchens                         |
| High-capacity 30mA       | â‚¬60 - â‚¬100           | Technical rooms, commercial installations   |

> **Info:** High-capacity circuit breakers are ideal for installations with high consumption or those exposed to harsh conditions.

### 5.2. Installation and Maintenance

To ensure proper functionality, it is recommended to have residual current circuit breakers installed by a qualified electrician. Monthly testing is advised: press the test button to verify the circuit breakerâ€™s response.

## 6. Consequences of Not Using Residual Current Circuit Breakers

### 6.1. Risk of Electrocution

Unprotected circuits increase the risk of electrocution, especially in high-risk areas. In the event of insulation failure, the absence of a residual current circuit breaker prevents the power from being cut, putting users in danger.

### 6.2. Risk of Fire

Unprotected circuits are also more prone to short circuits, which can lead to fires. The residual current circuit breaker reduces this risk by detecting and interrupting current leaks.

> **Safety Tip:** Unprotected circuits exposed to moisture are particularly vulnerable to short circuits. Make sure they are covered by a 30mA circuit breaker.

---

## 7. Testing and Verification Procedures

### 7.1. Recommended Monthly Test

It is advised to test the 30mA residual current circuit breaker at least once a month using the integrated test button. If the circuit breaker does not respond, it may require maintenance or replacement.

### 7.2. Professional Verification

Hiring a professional for an annual check ensures that the circuit breakers are functioning correctly and helps prevent potential failures.

| **Action**                | **Frequency**       | **Tips**                                       |
|---------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Manual test of the circuit breaker | Monthly            | Press the test button for verification         |
| Professional check        | Annual             | Ensures compliance and installation safety     |

## Conclusion

30mA residual current circuit breakers are essential for electrical circuit safety. They protect users against electric shocks by detecting current leaks. With the new RGIE regulations of 2023, it is crucial to ensure all installations are compliant and perform regular tests to guarantee proper functioning. Be sure to consult a professional if in doubt and adhere to safety standards for a secure and compliant installation.
