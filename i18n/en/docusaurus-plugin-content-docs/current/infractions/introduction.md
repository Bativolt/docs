# Introduction to Electrical Infractions

Safety in electrical installations is a **top priority**, both for users and for the professionals responsible for design, installation, and maintenance. Adhering to the safety standards set by the **Belgian Electrical Regulations** is crucial to protect people, property, and equipment from serious risks, such as electric shocks, fires, and costly failures. However, **electrical infractions** can occur at various stages: during installation, modifications, or maintenance. Even so-called "minor" infractions can have severe consequences for safety and cost.

## 1. Guide Objectives

This guide aims to:
- **Raise awareness** of the most common infractions in electrical installations,
- **Educate** about the associated risks and the regulations,
- **Provide solutions** for achieving compliance.

We will cover **eleven common electrical infractions**, each with significant implications for safety and compliance. Here are the infractions discussed in this guide, with a link to each page for more details:

1. **[Missing or Non-Compliant Electrical Schematics](https://docs.bativolt.com/en/docs/infractions/schema-electriques-absents)**: The importance of having up-to-date schematics to ensure a safe installation.
2. **[Insulation Resistance](https://docs.bativolt.com/en/docs/infractions/perte-electricite-isolation)**: Preventing current leaks and minimizing electricity losses with adequate insulation.
3. **[Non-Compliant or Missing Grounding](https://docs.bativolt.com/en/docs/infractions/absence-terre-sur-prises)**: Understanding exemptions for installations before 1981 and the risks of insufficient grounding.
4. **[Non-Compliant Electrical Panels](https://docs.bativolt.com/en/docs/infractions/tableau-electrique-non-conforme)**: The dangers of panels without proper protection.
5. **[Circuits Without 30mA Differential Protection](https://docs.bativolt.com/en/docs/infractions/circuits-non-proteges-differentiel)**: New requirements and enhanced protection in wet areas.
6. **[Non-Functional Differential Breakers](https://docs.bativolt.com/en/docs/infractions/disjoncteur-differentiel-non-fonctionnel)**: The need for regular testing of protective devices.
7. **[Missing Equipotential Bonding](https://docs.bativolt.com/en/docs/infractions/liaisons-equipotentielles-non-realisees)**: Preventing potential differences to avoid the risk of electric shocks.
8. **[Mixed Circuits with Different Cable Sizes](https://docs.bativolt.com/en/docs/infractions/circuits-mixtes-non-conformes)**: The dangers of mixing cables of different sizes.
9. **[Missing Grounding on Outlets](https://docs.bativolt.com/en/docs/infractions/absence-terre-sur-prises)**: Rules and exceptions for installations before 1981.
10. **[Installations Not Done According to Best Practices](https://docs.bativolt.com/en/docs/infractions/installation-non-realisee-regles-art)**: Non-compliant practices and associated risks.
11. **[Non-Compliance with Protection Ratings](https://docs.bativolt.com/en/docs/infractions/degres-protection-non-respectes)**: Risks and solutions for inadequate protection ratings.

Each page provides a **detailed analysis** of the infraction, associated risks, detection methods, solutions, and estimated costs for compliance.

## 2. Why Is Electrical Compliance Crucial?

Electrical compliance, as defined by the regulations, ensures:
- **User safety** by preventing electric shocks and fires,
- **Protection of property** from damage caused by defective equipment,
- **Reliability of the installation** to avoid service interruptions and costly repairs.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
Unresolved electrical infractions may result in **penalties during compliance inspections**. In cases of non-compliance, repairs may be required to ensure the safety of all occupants.

## 3. How to Detect and Correct Infractions

### Detection Methods
- **Visual Inspection**: Some infractions, like improperly protected cables, can be identified visually.
- **Technical Testing**: Tools such as a **megohmmeter** for insulation resistance testing or a **socket tester** for grounding checks can detect infractions not visible to the naked eye.
- **Professional Inspections**: Hiring a qualified electrician is essential for a comprehensive and compliant evaluation.

### Achieving Compliance
To ensure compliance, it is recommended to:
1. **Consult a certified electrician** for a thorough inspection.
2. **Follow the regulatory recommendations** for each type of infraction.
3. **Use high-quality, compliant materials** in accordance with the standards.
