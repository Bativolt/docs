# Non-compliant Circuits with Mixed Wire Gauges

## Introduction

Circuits that use different wire gauges, such as 1.5 mm² and 2.5 mm² wires, are considered **non-compliant** and pose significant risks to electrical safety. According to **Article 4.4.1 of the General Regulations on Electrical Installations (RGIE)**, it is essential to use appropriate wire gauges for each circuit. This page explains the reasons behind non-compliant circuits, the associated risks, and the regulatory requirements to avoid such issues.

## 1. What Is a Non-compliant Circuit with Mixed Wire Gauges?

### 1.1. Definition and Examples

A **non-compliant circuit** is one where multiple wire gauges are used improperly, creating imbalances and risks. For example, a circuit that starts with a 1.5 mm² wire for light outlets and continues with a 2.5 mm² wire for higher power devices can cause overloading and dangerous overheating.

> **Practical Example:** Using a 1.5 mm² wire to power high-demand appliances, such as electric heaters, increases the risk of fire. An **inadequate wire gauge** may not handle the electrical load, leading to overheating.

## 2. Why Do These Circuits Exist?

### 2.1. Non-compliant Extensions of Existing Installations

Sometimes, extensions are made without adhering to standards, such as using mixed wire sizes. This practice may be driven by budget constraints or poor planning.

### 2.2. Non-compliant Partial Renovations

During renovations, mixed circuits often appear due to the reuse of existing wires. These additions may seem cost-effective, but they do not comply with **RGIE** requirements and compromise the safety of the installation.

### 2.3. Convenience Practices

Some electricians use mixed circuits for easier work, which may seem convenient in the short term but creates long-term risks for users.

> **Warning:** An improperly configured electrical circuit can lead to high repair costs in case of failure. It is essential to follow standards to prevent these risks.

## 3. Risks Associated with Non-compliant Circuits

### 3.1. Fire Hazard

Inadequately sized wires can overheat and cause a fire. According to **RGIE Articles 5.1.3** and **5.2.1**, it is crucial to use properly sized conductors to avoid overloads.

:::danger
**Safety Warning:** A non-compliant installation significantly increases the risk of household fires. Ensure that your circuits are compliant to protect your home.

### 3.2. Circuit Overload

Thin wires cannot handle high loads. In a mixed circuit, the risk of overload is high, leading to wire deterioration and material damage.

| **Wire Gauge**   | **Maximum Capacity**        | **Risk Example**                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1.5 mm²          | Low load (lighting)         | Overload when connected to high-power devices    |
| 2.5 mm²          | Medium load (outlets)       | Can support typical household device loads       |

### 3.3. Regulatory Non-compliance

Failing to meet RGIE requirements exposes homeowners to penalties. A non-compliant circuit can be identified during an inspection, leading to fines and mandatory corrections.

## 4. Best Practices to Avoid Non-compliant Circuits

### 4.1. Proper Planning

Before making extensions or renovations, it is important to carefully plan the electrical installation. This includes selecting the appropriate wire gauges in accordance with **RGIE** requirements and load specifications.

> **Practical Tip:** Use a load calculation table to assess the power needs of each appliance before selecting the wire diameter.

### 4.2. Consultation with a Qualified Electrician

Hiring a qualified electrician to assess your electrical needs can prevent mixed circuits. These professionals are familiar with **RGIE** requirements and will ensure that each circuit is compliant.

### 4.3. Use of Compliant Materials

Using compliant wires, outlets, and devices is essential for a safe installation. High-quality wires reduce the risk of short circuits and other incidents.

> **Example:** For a compliant installation according to **RGIE**, ensure that each room meets the required wire dimensions based on the circuit type.

## 5. Regulatory Requirements

### 5.1. General Regulations on Electrical Installations (RGIE)

**Article 4.4.1** of the **RGIE** stipulates that each conductor must have an appropriate gauge for the supported load to ensure the safety of the installation. Any extension must comply with these requirements to prevent the risk of accidents.

### 5.2. Compliance Inspections

Electrical installations are subject to compliance inspections. Failure to meet the standards may result in penalties and the obligation to make corrections.

---

## 6. Compliance Procedures

### 6.1. Professional Evaluation

To ensure the safety of the installations, it is essential to have mixed circuits evaluated by a qualified electrician, who can identify inappropriate wire gauges and recommend modifications.

> **Tip:** Request a compliance report after each evaluation to keep a record of your installation's safety status.

### 6.2. Circuit Upgrades

Based on the evaluation results, it may be necessary to replace wires or reconfigure circuits. This upgrade ensures that each circuit meets RGIE safety standards.

---

## 7. Associated Costs

### 7.1. Evaluation Costs

A professional evaluation for mixed circuits typically costs between **€100 and €300**. The cost depends on the size of the installation and the necessary work.

### 7.2. Replacement and Compliance Costs

The cost of compliance work can range from **€500 to €2000**, depending on the extent of the necessary work and the materials to be replaced.

| **Type of Work**          | **Estimated Cost** | **Details**                               |
|---------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Evaluation                | €100 - €300        | Identification of non-compliant sections  |
| Compliance Work           | €500 - €2000       | Replacement of cables and corrections     |

## Conclusion

Non-compliant circuits with mixed wire gauges pose a significant risk to the safety of electrical installations. It is crucial to adhere to **RGIE** requirements to avoid the risks of fire, overload, and non-compliance. By hiring a qualified electrician and following best practices, you can ensure that your installation is safe and compliant.
