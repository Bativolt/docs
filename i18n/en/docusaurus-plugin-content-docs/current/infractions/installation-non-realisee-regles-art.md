# Installation Not Carried Out According to Best Practices

## Introduction

A **non-compliant electrical installation** is a common infraction, often resulting from a lack of training, inappropriate material choices, or rushed practices. These non-compliant installations pose significant risks to the safety of people and property. Understanding the reasons for non-compliance, the dangers involved, and the appropriate solutions is essential for ensuring maximum safety.

:::danger Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
A faulty installation increases the risk of electric shocks, fires, and can lead to legal actions. **Safety should never be compromised.**
:::

## 1. What Does This Mean?

### 1.1. Definition

A compliant installation adheres to current standards, particularly the **Belgian Electrical Regulations**. This includes:
- The use of certified materials
- The application of appropriate installation techniques
- Respect for environmental specifications

:::tip Technical Info
Compliant installations follow specific articles of the Belgian Electrical Regulations, such as **Article 104**, which specifies the obligation to carry out installations according to best practices.
:::

### 1.2. Importance of Compliance

Non-compliant installations expose users to risks of electric shocks, fires, and equipment malfunctions. In case of an accident, the owner may be held liable, with legal and financial implications.

## 2. Reasons for Non-Compliant Installations

### 2.1. Lack of Technical Knowledge

Some installers may lack sufficient training or be unaware of current standards, leading to installation errors.

:::info Tip üí°
Installers should attend continuous training to stay informed of updates to the Belgian Electrical Regulations and best practices.
:::

### 2.2. Cost-Cutting Practices

Cost reduction may lead some property owners to opt for lower-quality materials or skip certain protections, compromising safety.

### 2.3. Time Pressure

Under tight deadlines, some essential details may be overlooked, compromising the safety of the installation.

:::warning Risk üìâ
Saving time and money on an electrical installation can be much more costly in the event of a disaster!

## 3. Examples of Non-Compliant Installations

### 3.1. Poorly Executed Wiring

Poorly insulated cables, loose connections, or undersized cables can cause short circuits and overheating, increasing the risk of fire.

### 3.2. Use of Non-Compliant Materials

Using inappropriate materials, such as unprotected cables in damp environments, compromises safety.

### 3.3. Lack of Protection

The absence of circuit breakers or fuses leaves the installation vulnerable to short circuits and overloads, which can be particularly dangerous in high-consumption areas.

## 4. Possible Resolutions

### 4.1. Professional Evaluation

It is crucial to have suspect installations evaluated by a qualified electrician. This assessment helps identify non-compliances and propose solutions.

:::info Why Consult a Professional?
Licensed electricians are familiar with the Belgian Electrical Regulations and can ensure compliance according to the current standards.
:::

### 4.2. Upgrading the Installations

Upgrading involves replacing non-compliant elements, adding missing protections, and reorganizing installations if necessary.

### 4.3. Training and Awareness

Raising awareness about the Belgian Electrical Regulations and proper practices reduces future violations and enhances the safety of installations.

## 5. Costs Associated with Compliance

### 5.1. Evaluation and Inspection

A thorough inspection costs between **‚Ç¨100 and ‚Ç¨300**, depending on the size of the installation and the complexity of the work.

### 5.2. Repairs and Upgrades

The costs of bringing an installation up to compliance vary depending on the nature of the work, ranging from **a few hundred to several thousand euros**.

### 5.3. Importance of the Investment

Investing in compliance is a commitment to safety. In the event of an incident, the savings made on safety measures can lead to much higher costs.

:::tip Why Invest in Compliance?
Ensuring the compliance of your installation is an act of responsibility towards users and property. The initial cost is a preventive measure against future expenses.
:::

## Conclusion

An installation not carried out according to best practices poses a major risk to safety. By identifying the causes of non-compliance, conducting regular inspections, and upgrading installations, optimal safety can be ensured. Awareness of best practices and regulatory requirements is essential to prevent installation defects in the future.
